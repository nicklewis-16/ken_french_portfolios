This file was created by CMPT_ME_BEME_OP_INV_RETS using the 202312 CRSP database.
It contains value- and equal-weighted returns for portfolios formed on OP and INV.

The portfolios are constructed at the end of June. OP is operating profits (sales - cost
of goods sold - selling, general and administrative expenses - interest expense) divided by book
at the last fiscal year end of the prior calendar year. INV is the change
in total assets from the fiscal year ending in year t-2 to the fiscal year ending in t-1,
divided by t-2 total assets.
Annual returns are from January to December.

Missing data are indicated by -99.99 or -999.

Please be aware that some of the value-weight averages of operating profitability for
deciles 1 and 10 are extreme. These are driven by extraordinary values of OP for
individual firms. We have spot checked the accounting data that produce the
extraordinary values and all the numbers we examined accurately reflect the
data in the firmÂ’s accounting statements.

The break points include utilities and include financials.

The  portfolios  include utilities and include financials.
